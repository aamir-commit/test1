This is the process of second Commit, i want to see the changes that are made for the git pull
Some other developer his name is anonymous has commited this change
so lets see whether it is working or not....


There is a famous line which says ...
"Grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change and the courage to change the things i can
and the wisdom to know the difference"

and this is the third commit which i am doing and maybe i will be successful in this attempt and there are many things i need to be changed
and there is a big relief and there is no need to see the changes
